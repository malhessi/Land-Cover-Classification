# Access to Dataset
The dataset is the Sentinel-2 Satellite Image of the Gaza Strip. It has a too large size so that I didn't upload it here.
The image is necessary to extract the training data to be used with the Machine Learning algorithms. There are two choices to access the data:
1) Download the image from the following [Zipped File]() and extracted into `S2B` folder. or,
2) Use the already extracted training data without going to the image processing steps (the first 4 steps in the script file). You can find these data in the folder `data` with the file name `data.rda`. So, you can run the script file from the step 5.
